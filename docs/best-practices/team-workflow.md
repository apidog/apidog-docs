# Teamwork Process

## Best Practice

1. Front-end developers (or back-end developers) draft API documentation in Apidog.
2. Front-end and back-end developers work collaboratively to review and improve documentation, and align on API use cases.
3. Front-end developers can get started with development using Mock data automatically generated based on API documentation in Apidog without manually writing mock rules.
4. Back-end developers can debug using API use cases during development. As long as all API use cases passed debugging, the API development is complete. If there are changes in the API during development, the API documentation is automatically updated during debugging, which guarantees the timeliness of API maintenance at zero cost.
5. After debugging, backend developers can directly save the function as an API use case.
6. QA engineers can test API directly using API use cases.
7. After all the APIs have been developed, QA engineers (or backend developers) can utilize the test collection function to carry out multi-API integration testing to thoroughly test the API calling process.
8. Joint debugging normally goes extremely smoothly when front-end and back-end development is completed and the front-end developers have switched from mock data to real data because both front-end and back-end developers fully adhere to the API's specifications.
