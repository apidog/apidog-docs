# Bulk Interface Management

To improve the ability of interface management, the `Bulk Interface Management` feature has been added in versions after 2.2.19.

You can browse all interface documentation under a directory on the `All APIs` tab and perform bulk operations such as `bulk deletion` and bulk movement.

## Browse All Interface

1. If you need to view all interfaces of the current project, click the `All APIs` tab under the `Root Directory`. If you need to view all interfaces under a specific directory/microservice, click on the corresponding directory.
