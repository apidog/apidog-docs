# Dynamic Variables/Random Parameters

The values of dynamic variables are generated at the time of execution based on certain rules.

## Operating Path

When the cursor is placed over the input box, a magic wand icon will appear at the location of the example value of the request parameter. Click on it to set the dynamic variable.
