# Code Generation


## Features 

Apidog can automatically generate business logic code (such as Model, Controller, unit test code, etc.) and API request code for various languages/frameworks (such as TypeScript, Java, Go, Swift, ObjectiveC, Kotlin, Dart, C++, C#, Rust, etc.) based on the API model definition. Currently, Apidog supports automatic code generation for 130 languages and frameworks.

You can also use customized code templates to generate code that complies with the architectural requirements set forth by your own team to satisfy different needs.
