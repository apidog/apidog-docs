# Install Java Environment

#### 1. Where to download Java JDK

[Download](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/)

We recommend downloading JDK for Java. JRE works for most Windows computers but not all. Therefore, we recommend downloading JDK for Java.

To check whether the Java environment is installed successfully, go to the command line and run java -version. The installation is successful if the java version is logged to the output.

#### 2. Please be aware that

If Apidog cannot detect java environment, please try the following two solutions:

1. Turn off Apidog and restart it after a few seconds.
2. If 1 does not work, restart the computer.
